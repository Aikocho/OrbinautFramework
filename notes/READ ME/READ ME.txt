	Welcome to Orbinaut Framework!

	We recommened to use the master version of Orbinaut (basically the code from GitHub) instead of the one 
	provided in the release package as it can have a few fixes that aren't present in the release package version.

	In any case, even if you have downloaded the master please, download the release package,
	as it includes our Collision Editor and PDF Documentation. It is always available at this link:
	
	https://github.com/TrianglyRU/OrbinautFramework/releases
	
	If you encounter any glitch/bug/inaccuracy and are familiar with GitHub:
	- if you find the way to fix it, you may pull request to our repository
	- if you can't fix it, please, create an Issue
	
	Thank you for choosing our framework <3

	QUICK START:
	- You can setup various framework flags in GameSetup(). * Make sure to change "FolderName" first! *
	- Do not create a new room for your stage, just dublicate Stage_Template room;
	- When creating a new stage, you SHOULD initialise a collision tileset for it in GameCollisionsSetup();
	- When creating a new stage, you can also initialise a palette sheet for it, if needed, in PaletteSetup();
	- When in DevMode, you can use keys F1-F12. F4 is always enabled and toggles fullscreen.
	- If you get an error like "can't open the file" when trying to run the project, run GMS2 as Administrator;
