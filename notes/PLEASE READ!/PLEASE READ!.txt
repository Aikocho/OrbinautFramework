	You have downloaded the master branch version or of Orbinaut Framework, 
	which does not contain documentation and our Collision Editor.

	Although this version can be used, we strongly recommend downloading 
	the necessary resources by downloading the release package available at this link: 
	
	https://github.com/TrianglyRU/OrbinautFramework/releases
	
	Also, this version may lack some bugfixes and improvements (or have bugs but probably not) 
	that are not present in the release version. In any case, the release version is always the stable one!
	
	Thank you for choosing our framework <3
