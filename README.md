# Orbinaut Framework
An accurate classic Sonic framework, made for GameMaker Studio 2.

# Features
- Classic-accurate physics.
- Orignal-engine-like stage collision method based on distances.
- Various toggable frameworks tweaks, including differences between classic trilogy games.
- Discord Rich Presence support.
- Solid optimization.
- and much more!

# Architecture
Orbinaut is built to be simple to use and easy to understand. All main global code is stored in scripts that are called from the framework 
controllers or objects. There is no code directly in events. The project library is sorted and organized as compact and understandable as possible, 
so it's very difficult to get lost navigating it.

# Documentation
Orbinaut has its own documentation where we explain how the framework works, how to do things and how each custom function works. Including pictures, 
everyone likes pictures! (Coming soon!)
