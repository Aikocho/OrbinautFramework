# Orbinaut Framework
An accurate classic Sonic framework, made for GameMaker Studio 2.

# Features
- Classic-accurate physics.
- Orignal-engine-like stage collision method based on distances.
- Two types of stage collision: collision masks or actual tiles with pre-calculated angles.
- Improved original object collision method. Instead of copying it directly, we used it as a basis to make our own.
- Various toggable frameworks tweaks, including differences between classic trilogy games.
- Discord Rich Presence support.
- Solid optimization.
- and much more!

# Architecture
Orbinaut is built to be simple to use and easy to understand. All main global code is stored in scripts that are called from the framework 
controllers (Player, Game, Input, Screen, Discord, Stage), and objects perform code on their own. The project library is sorted 
and organized as compact and understandable as possible, so it's very difficult to get lost navigating it.

# Custom functions
We coded a bunch of custom functions to make your game making process more easier. For example, you can apply a parallax to your background in 5 minutes using 
just one object, no need to make multiple layers.

# Documentation
Orbinaut has its own documentation where we explain how the framework works, how to do things and how each custom function works. Including pictures, 
everyone likes pictures!
