IMPORTANT: It is recommended to re-export the project with a different name (File -> Export -> YYZ). If you don't do that,
there may be save file conflicts with other projects using Orbinaut Framework that kept the default project name


INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES
=======================

Orbinaut Framework uses a custom GameMaker effect to provide distortion effects. In order to be able to run and compile the game in IDE, 
you have to install it. Grab the _filter_waves folder inside the _dependencies folder and COPY it to:

Windows: C:/ProgramData/GameMakerStudio2/Cache/runtimes/(latest_runtime)/bin/FiltersAndEffects
Mac OS: Users/Shared/GameMakerStudio2/Cache/runtimes/(latest_runtime)/bin/FiltersAndEffects

Please note the each time GameMaker runtime is updated, you have to re-install the effect!

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

Issue: Launching the playable build resulting in "can't read byte" error
Solution: Remove the OrbinautFramework folder from AppData -> Local

Issue: Unable to launch the game from GameMaker (can't open file error)
Solution: Launch GameMaker with admin permissions

PLAYABLE BUILD FAQ
==================

Q: I can't use Game Start, it results in a message that stage is unable to load!
A: You aren't supposed to use Game Start. This is the build of how the framework itself is provided
(i.e. for those who don't have GameMaker installed). Please, use Scene Select

Q: Am I able to toggle various features that were noted in About section?
A: No, that's only possible with the project itself.
